		<h2 class="projectOver">Dynamic Functionality on the website:</h2>

		<p>The website will feature clickable images for on the purchase portion of the site. If the user clicks an image, it will redirect them to that items page so 
			that they can buy the item. Similar to. <a href= "https://stockx.com/?&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=US-BrandedStockX&utm_campaignid=885270610&content=257498558783&keyword=stockx&gclid=Cj0KCQjwqp-LBhDQARIsAO0a6aLOxty4Yv1-IH8RguLZ0dpXfguV2QDqOA2mLy_ds1x4grzI30mD4gEaAqLsEALw_wcB&gclsrc=aw.ds."></a>
			I want the user to be able to very as many images of the item as possible buy getting a visual of the item, they want to buy by clicking it. This will be done on the shopping pages and the checkout page. The site will also add the totals of items you want to buy and keeps track of how much the user spends. 
			This will also be done on the checkout page. I want the user to be able to click a next button to have a new image pop up similar to how best by has multiple images but at different angles <a href= "https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-playstation-5-console/6426149.p?skuId=6426149"></a>
